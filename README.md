## Launching The Game
Once the launcher and all of its dependencies have been installed, you can launch PyCraft.

Run the "PyCraft Launcher.py" file to open the launcher.

Once inside the launcher, you will be able to choose your version of PyCraft and then launch it. When installing the launcher and game for the first time, you will only have the latest version of the game installed. If you are interested in trying older versions of PyCraft, you can install them from the releases page of this repository. To navigate to your installed releases folder, click on the directory button next to the version dropdown:

From here, you can move any installed versions of the game into this folder.

When ready to launch PyCraft, select the version you would like to play and click the play button.

## Installing Updates
### There are 2 ways that you can install new versions of PyCraft:

### Method 1 (Launcher)
To check for new versions and install the latest version of PyCraft through the launcher, simply click the "Check For Updates" button in the top right corner. This will automatically check this repository for a new release and will install it directly to your versions folder. Experimental versions and snapshots cannot be installed through the launcher and must be installed using method 2.
